# Thesis
Code for the Thesis included

Here are 3 files crated on Jupyter Notebook with all the codes that was used during this thesis work
They will not operate without all the files like scripts, models and so on. Those files woudn't be uploaded to this repo, because there are 1.9 GB of data.

One more .pdf file with links to articles, which were included to paper work.

Sincerely, Alen Assemov | ERZOSV
